This folder contains all the weekly schedules that were created for this project.
The weekly schedules were created at the beginning of each week and shared with the mentor through Microsoft Teams.
These schedules were created so that the mentor was up to date with the progress of the project, and also allowed our team to have an understanding of what
each member in the team was working on, and how this contributed to the overall project aims.
