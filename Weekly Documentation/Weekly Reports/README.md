**Weekly Reports**
This folder contains all the weekly reports that were created for this project. 
The weekly reports were created at the beginning of each week and shared with the mentor through Microsoft Teams. 
These reports were created so that the mentor was up to date and could gain and understanding of the progress to the project in the last week. This also 
allowed our team to reflect on the past week, and assign work for the upcoming week according to the progress that was reflected upon from the previous
week.
