# The Project and Source Control

* The master branch is considered stable/release and should always have a working prototype.
* Best practices is to branch off from the master or development branch and start working
on a feature-branch.
* Never work on the master branch directly, bad things happen then.
* Avoid force-pushing to any branch, ideally create a new branch and push to that.
* If you are the sole person working on the branch (check beforehand) then it is OK sometimes 
to force-push to that branch.
* Seek review before pulling anything to another branch.
(note this will not always possible so use the best judgment at the time).
This kind of work-flow allows multiple features to be developed simultaneously without 
interfering with important aspects like project compilation.
